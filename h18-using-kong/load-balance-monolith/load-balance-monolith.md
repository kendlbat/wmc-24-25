Start the services and the gateway using:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Stop the services and the gateway using:

```bash
./stop.sh
```

Note that you will need to have `curl` and `jq` installed on your system.
You also need either `podman` or `docker` installed.
I tested the scripts with `podman` on Arch Linux `6.13.5-arch1-1`
